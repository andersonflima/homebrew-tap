  # The app installs and refreshes the auto-update LaunchAgent itself, at
  # startup. Homebrew deprecated `postflight` (arbitrary Ruby) in favour of a
  # sandboxed declarative DSL that cannot write a helper script and a plist
  # under $HOME, and owning it in the app also covers a non-brew install.
  # Unload the agent on uninstall (no sudo). Files are trashed by `--zap`.
